    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/-kVdyeW7at8AAAAC/tonkatsu-japanese-food.gif">
    <p>Tonkatsu is a popular dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. The pork is
        usually pounded thin, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried until crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
        It is commonly served with a tonkatsu sauce, a sweet and savory sauce that is similar to Worcestershire sauce,
        and served over rice or with shredded cabbage. Tonkatsu is a staple of Japanese comfort food and can be found at
        many restaurants in Japan.

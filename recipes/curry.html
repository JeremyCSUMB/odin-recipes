    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/T0HpdzqRLT8AAAAC/japanese-curry.gif">
    <p>Japanese curry is a popular dish in Japan, often referred to as "curry rice". It is a mild and slightly sweet
        dish made with a roux-based sauce that is seasoned with a blend of spices, and typically contains meat,
        vegetables, and potatoes. The sauce is served over steamed rice, making it a hearty and filling meal. The dish
        has its roots in Indian cuisine and was introduced to Japan in the late 19th century, where it has since been
        adapted and modified to fit local tastes. Japanese curry is a beloved comfort food and is widely available at
        restaurants and cafes in Japan, as well as in instant form for home cooking.

    <ol>

            In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat.
            <ul>
                <li>Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the curry roux and add enough water to the pot to make a thick sauce, about 2-3 cups.

            Bring the sauce to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and let cook for 20-30 minutes, until the vegetables
            are tender and the flavors have melded together.

            Serve the Japanese curry over steamed rice.

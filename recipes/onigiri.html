    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/nURLx5e1n7IAAAAd/jelly-filled-donut-brock.gif">
    <p>Onigiri is a popular Japanese snack food made of rice that is molded into a triangular or cylindrical shape and
        often filled with various ingredients such as salmon, tuna, umeboshi (pickled plum), or katsuobushi (dried
        bonito flakes). Onigiri is wrapped in nori (dried seaweed) to hold the filling inside and is a portable and
        convenient food that can be enjoyed as a snack or a meal. It is a staple food in Japan and is widely available
        in convenience stores, supermarkets, and food vendors. Onigiri is often made using leftover rice from the
        previous meal and is a simple and affordable way to enjoy a tasty and filling meal on the go.</p>
